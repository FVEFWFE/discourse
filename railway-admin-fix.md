# Fix Admin Access on Railway Discourse

## Option 1: Add Admin Email Variable
Add this to Railway Variables:
```
DISCOURSE_ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com
DISCOURSE_DEVELOPER_EMAILS=your@email.com
```
Then redeploy and sign up with that email.

## Option 2: Switch to Standard Discourse
The Bitnami image is causing issues. Consider deploying standard Discourse:

1. Delete current service
2. Create new service
3. Deploy from GitHub instead:
   - Source: GitHub repo
   - Add Dockerfile (see below)
   - Deploy

## Standard Discourse Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM discourse/base:latest
WORKDIR /var/www/discourse
COPY . .
RUN bundle install
RUN yarn install
CMD ["bundle", "exec", "rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

## Option 3: Use Different Platform
If Railway + Bitnami is too complex:
- Render.com - Better Discourse support
- Fly.io - More control
- DigitalOcean App Platform - Easier setup
```
