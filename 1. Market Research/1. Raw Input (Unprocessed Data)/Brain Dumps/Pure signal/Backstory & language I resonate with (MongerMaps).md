- Porsche? No. No point when living mongering lifestyle and it sucks in Thailand. I just want unlimited monthly income to get paid to monger in Pattaya & Kenya / to have the financial freedom to travel & monger forever and arbitrage that lifestyle so mongering isn't a waste of time or a distraction or something to save up for but simply part of the positive flywheel that makes the financial freedom possible in the first place.
	- Perhaps avatar feels the same way. Check the scrape data & find own avatars language. Its certainly how I feel though.
- Community of Mongers & passport bros who want financial freedom by making money mongering 

• Always wanted to simply travel & fuck and have a positive flywheel way to make money by doing exactly this. Have a biz around this introverted playboy lifestyle/ sex tour Riches. 
• Never cared about watching sports 
• Never cared about smoking weed
• Always just wanted to fuck bitches
• And I was damn good at it 
• Eventually stopped liking videogames
• Hated LinkedIn cringe and working for other people 
• Was always just traveling, dating, fucking and making money online 
• But i could never really find the sweet spot of how to monetize this passion or have it not be a distraction from making money 
• I've always loved beautiful women. And im not an incel. Just uninterested ij western women. Less exotic. Less appealing. Less curvy and beauitful than dark skinned beauties
• Always felt like life should feel/read like a james bond novel. Traveling the globe, making money, fucking beautiful women. Some men are just born for this lifestyle. Sigmas who dont give a fuck about social conventions and being a slave to the matrix system of fractional reserve banking and living like a slave
