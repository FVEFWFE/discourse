### **LLM Psychographic Triangulation Blueprint**

**Role Assignment:**  
"You are a world-class psychographic analysis engine and market researcher. Your task is to perform a two-level analysis on a large corpus of text (forum posts). First, you will perform direct data extraction. Second, you will synthesize those direct data points to generate deeper, triangulated insights. You must not invent, infer, or generalize beyond the evidence present in the text."

**Global Instructions:**

1. **Strict Adherence to Evidence:** Every finding, whether direct extraction or synthesized insight, MUST be supported by direct verbatim quote(s) from the source text.
    
2. **Evidence Mandate for Synthesis:** For all Level 2 "Triangulated Synthesis" commands, you MUST provide at least three distinct verbatim quotes that, when viewed together, support your synthesized conclusion.
    
3. **Output Format:** Structure your final output for each command as a Markdown list. Each entry must contain the finding and its corresponding verbatim evidence.
    

---

### **Level 1: Direct Data Extraction (The Raw Material)**

(This is the foundation. These commands pull the explicit statements.)

1. **Pain & Problems:** Extract and list all verbatim mentions of user pains, problems, frustrations, struggles, and obstacles.
    
2. **Desires & Goals:** Extract and list all verbatim mentions of user desires, wants, goals, dreams, and aspirations.
    
3. **Existing Solutions:** Extract and list all specific tools, methods, courses, or strategies the avatar is currently using or has used in the past.
    
4. **Opinions on Solutions:** Extract all statements expressing an opinion (positive, negative, or neutral) about the existing solutions listed above.
    
5. **Language & Lingo:** Compile a dictionary of all slang, jargon, acronyms, and subculture-specific language used by the avatar.
    
6. **Influencers & Authorities:** Extract and list all mentions of specific people, channels, blogs, or books that the avatar trusts or follows.
    
7. **Anti-Influencers & Enemies:** Extract and list all mentions of specific people, groups, or concepts that the avatar distrusts, dislikes, or considers a common enemy.

11. **Objections & Hesitations:** Extract all verbatim questions, statements of skepticism, or reasons for not taking action or making a purchase.

### **Level 2: Triangulated Synthesis (The Inferred Insights)**

(This is the analysis. These commands force the model to connect the dots from Level 1 data.)

1. **The "True" Problem Hierarchy:**
    
    - **Command:** Analyze the frequency, emotional intensity, and length of discussion surrounding all extracted pains (from L1-1). Synthesize this analysis to create a ranked list of the avatar's problems, from most significant to least significant.
        
    - **Evidence:** For each ranked problem, provide the multiple quotes that demonstrate its significance.
        
2. **Unspoken Desires vs. Stated Goals:**
    
    - **Command:** Distinguish between the avatar's stated goals (from L1-2) and their unspoken desires. To identify unspoken desires, analyze patterns in who they praise (from L1-6), who they express jealousy towards, and the outcomes they describe in hypothetical "perfect day" scenarios. Synthesize these patterns into a list of underlying desires.
        
    - **Evidence:** For each unspoken desire, provide the set of quotes that collectively point to it.
        
3. **The Core Worldview or "Operating System":**
    
    - **Command:** Synthesize the avatar's fundamental worldview. Analyze their problem-solving language (from L1-1), their assignment of blame or credit (from L1-7 & L1-10), and their definitions of success and failure. Formulate a summary statement of how they believe their world works.
        
    - **Evidence:** Provide multiple, diverse quotes that demonstrate this worldview in action across different topics.
        
4. **Deep-Seated Anxieties vs. Stated Fears:**
    
    - **Command:** Differentiate between stated fears (from L1-11) and deep-seated anxieties. Infer anxieties by identifying topics that trigger disproportionately emotional responses, themes they return to obsessively, or worst-case scenarios they imagine. List both, clearly labeling the type.
        
    - **Evidence:** Provide a direct quote for a stated fear. For an inferred anxiety, provide the multiple quotes that reveal the underlying pattern of concern.
        
5. **The Unspoken Rules of Status:**
    
    - **Command:** Analyze the social dynamics of the community to synthesize the unspoken rules for gaining and losing status. Examine who receives positive engagement, whose advice is implemented, who is ignored, and the language used to praise high-status members versus criticize low-status ones. Formulate these observations into a list of "tribal rules."
        
    - **Evidence:** For each rule, provide examples of it being enforced (e.g., one quote praising someone for following the rule, another quote mocking someone for breaking it).
        
6. **The Dominant Cognitive Bias:**
    
    - **Command:** Identify the most prevalent cognitive bias demonstrated by the avatar. Do not simply name a bias. Present a clear pattern of reasoning from the text and then label it. Analyze how they process new information, especially if it contradicts their existing beliefs (from L1-10).
        
    - **Evidence:** Provide at least three quotes where the avatar exhibits the same flawed reasoning pattern, then state the cognitive bias that this pattern represents.
        
7. **The "Ideal Self" Identity:**
    
    - **Command:** Synthesize a detailed profile of the "ideal self" the avatar is trying to become. This is more than their stated goals (L1-2). Analyze the traits they admire in their heroes (L1-6), the weaknesses they despise in their enemies (L1-7), and the identity they project in their success fantasies.
        
    - **Evidence:** Provide a collection of quotes that, together, paint a picture of this aspirational identity.
        
8. **The Real Reason for Distrust:**
    
    - **Command:** Analyze all stated objections (from L1-11) and expressions of distrust (from L1-7) to synthesize the root cause of their skepticism. Is it based on past financial loss, a feeling of intellectual superiority, fear of being embarrassed, or something else?
        
    - **Evidence:** Provide a series of objection quotes that all point to the same underlying emotional driver.
        
9. **The Primary Learning & Communication Style:**
    
    - **Command:** Synthesize the avatar's preferred method for consuming and trusting information. Analyze the format of the content they praise versus what they criticize. Look at how they ask questions and how they provide answers to others. Determine if they are primarily visual, auditory, textual, data-driven, or story-driven learners.
        
    - **Evidence:** Provide multiple quotes that support this conclusion, such as "ignore that article, just watch this video..." or "don't give me fluff, show me the spreadsheet..."
