# MongerMaps Frontend Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully integrated the v0 frontend components with the existing T3 stack backend, creating a fully functional intelligence platform with monetization features.

## What We've Built

### 1. Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

- **KPI Cards**: Display 24h vibe shift, fair prices, report counts, and active scam alerts
- **Watchlist & Game Plan**: Personalized venue recommendations
- **Paywall Integration**: Free users see blurred/limited data with upgrade prompts
- **Live Data**: Connected to tRPC intelligence router pulling from database

### 2. Interactive Map (`/map/pattaya`)
- **Mapbox Integration**: Real map with venue markers color-coded by vibe score
  - Green: Score ≥ 8
  - Yellow: Score 6-8  
  - Red: Score < 6
- **Advanced Filters**: Venue type, district, vibe score range, price range, tags
- **Veteran's Path**: Premium feature showing optimal venue routes
- **Venue Popups**: Click markers to see venue details and link to full dossier

### 3. Venue Detail Pages (`/venue/[id]`)

```

## Environment Variables Needed

```env

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_pk
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_sk
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Get live version running

6. **Marketing Launch**: Drive traffic to capture leads

The frontend is now production-ready with a complete monetization flow. The freemium model creates strong incentives to upgrade while providing enough value to attract users initially.
