# Setting Up MongerMaps on GitHub

## Steps to Create Your Own Repository

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `mongermaps`
3. Set it as **Private** (for now)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code

After creating the empty repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add your new repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mongermaps.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Verify Success

Your repository should now show:
- 112 files
- Complete MongerMaps MVP code
- No connection to Discourse
- Clean commit history

### 4. GitHub Actions (Optional)

Since this is a Next.js project, not Discourse, you won't have those failing tests. You can add appropriate GitHub Actions later:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run type check
      run: npm run type-check
    
    - name: Run linter
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Run build
      run: npm run build
```

## Repository Structure

Your new MongerMaps repository contains:

```
mongermaps/
├── src/
│   ├── app/           # Next.js app directory
│   ├── components/    # React components
│   ├── server/        # Backend API (tRPC)
│   └── lib/          # Utilities
├── prisma/           # Database schema
├── public/           # Static assets
├── scraper/          # Forum scraping tools
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

## No More Discourse Test Failures!

The failing tests you saw were from Discourse (Ruby forum software). Your MongerMaps project:
- Is a standalone Next.js/TypeScript application
- Has its own dependencies and structure
- Won't have those unrelated test failures

## Next Steps

1. Create the GitHub repository
2. Push your code
3. Set up environment variables in production
4. Deploy to Vercel (recommended for Next.js)

Your MongerMaps platform is now completely independent and ready for deployment!
